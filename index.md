You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/devDukes-99/devDukes-99.github.io-reading-notes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

1. **Creating a gh-Page**

Creating a github page is simple, but first thing you will need is an valid email and then a git hub account. Github is a site mainly used for developers, it has a lot of features and is widely supported by the community, one feature of github is creating a webpage and it's also fast and simple just make a repository with same name but add ".github.io" after owner name like this.

this will create a link to the webpage you will create, then after that just head to setting tab in that repo, select github pages, and then just click choose a theme and start editing your page!!

2. **markdown**
"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor."

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/devDukes-99/devDukes-99.github.io-reading-notes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
